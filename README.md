Depends: 
- Magic Forms Plugin https://github.com/skydiver/october-plugin-forms

This plugin extends october-plugin-forms with custom, Input-specific backend views and management. 
This is useful in cases where you would like to use magic forms for the frontend form construction, but need more control over the backend display and management of the input fields. 

In this particular implement, magic forms builds a common frrontend contact form (name, email, subject, message) and its inout is diverted to this plugin for backend review.
